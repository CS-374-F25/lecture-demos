When you open a file in a program, a file descriptor is created to represent
the program's handle on that file.

File descriptors are actually just integers.

File descriptor 0 represents standard input.
File descriptor 1 represents standard output.
File descriptor 2 represents standard error.

If the process proceeds to open more files using fopen() or open(), those
opened files also get file descriptors counting up from 3

Every process has its own mappings from file descriptors to files.

Every process has a file descriptor table. This table maps file descriptors to
files for each process.
